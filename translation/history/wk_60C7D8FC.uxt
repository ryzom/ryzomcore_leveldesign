uiAppear_Infos_Fyros	[THE FYROS CIVILIZATION\n
	\n
	The Fyros are a determined, loyal and fierce civilization who rank themselves among the greatest Atysian warriors. They are the offspring of a once despotic state whose society still rests on a strict code of honour and a common goal, namely the quest for the Great Dragon who has ravaged entire regions and threatens to rear its ugly head again and let loose all its hellfire (according to the sayings of the Karavan).\n
	In their dogged pursuit of this quest, the Fyros readily transgress Jena Law and Karavan interdiction concerning delving down into the bowels of Atys. Indeed, the search for the truth behind the Great Dragon has become a vehicle for their intellectual advancement, leading them to uncover as many mysterious relics as evils.\n
	They have since rebuilt their towns and villages in the parched desert lands, where it is thought the Dragon is most likely to resurface. From these inhospitable dunes the Fyros strive to protect Atys, restore their Empire and develop their already extensive knowledge of the fabrication of fire-toughened tools and weaponry.\n
	\n
	HISTORY\n
	\n
	Nomadic desert tribes first established their stronghold to the north of the forest lands, around the oasis of Fyre. The first great Fyros Empire was founded in 2275 by the remarkable warrior, Dyros the Great, who led campaigns to secure mineral resources and established a route through Matis dominions to Tryker lake lands in order to set up a water supply for the expanding population. Under his wise rule an alliance was forged between Tryker and Fyros peoples. Trykers would convoy water supplies to Fyros cities in exchange for protection against their domineering neighbours, the Matis.\n
	Under the long rule of Abylus the Learned, a council of chroniclers was set up to write a history of the Fyros. After an accidental discovery of mysterious ancient ruins in the Prime Roots, the council set up a company of miners to search for knowledge of the past and the mythical Dragon. But miners working in the area of Coriolis hit upon an underground vein of acid sap. The gushing sap subsequently caused a fire which blazed through the parched vegetation of the wastelands, devouring everything in its path for two weeks solid until the rains came. During the Fire of Coriolis, as it came to be known, many Fyros lives and habitations were lost.\n
	To add to this, the water route was cut off both by fire and Matis warriors, who took the opportunity to overrun Tryker lake lands. Abylus had little choice but to act quickly or face certain death through lack of water. True to their determined nature, after having buried their dead and mustered all their forces, the Fyros turned against the Matis. In spite of many skirmishes with Matis forces, their empire came to shine once again in all its glory for the next two generations.\n
	\n
	The Empire declined suddenly in the year 2481, during the reign of Cerakos II. Excavators working in the Prime Roots came upon a nest of kitins. In their fear, they slaughtered the giant insects and triggered a great swarming of soldier kitins that massacred all traces of hominkind throughout the ancient lands in an event known as the Great Swarming.\n
	\n
	HOW THEY SEE:\n
	\n
	The Karavan\n
	Traditionally, the Karavan are venerated as disciples of Jena and powerful armed forces. But during the Great Swarming, the Fyros realized that the Karavan did not manage to stop the Kitins invasion. The Fyros also believe that the Karavan didn't do enough to save more homins. Since then, there is much doubt regarding the Karavan's role on Atys.\n
	\n
	The Kamis\n
	As with any phenomenon whose mechanism they are unable to grasp, the Fyros behold the Kamis with a wary eye and refuse blind adherence to their teachings. But despite their reticence, the Fyros hold them in awe and are prepared to make pacts with the Kamis in exchange for their esteemed magic.\n
	\n
	Elias Tryton\n
	Fyros elders speak of a man in a nimbus of fire that came from the sky in a glint of light. He appeared to a chosen few at the time of the Great Swarming to help guide their people to safety through a Rainbow.]

uiAppear_Infos_Matis	[THE MATIS CIVILIZATION\n
	\n
	Highly cultivated aesthetes well versed in forest botany, the Matis are both a romantic and domineering race. They staunchly believe that, just as every particle of the universe has a function, every homin must strive for her or his true place in society. Their obsession with genetic mutations has made them Atysian Master Manipulators of plant and animal life. Their weaponry, armor and even familiar household items are living objects.\n
	The Matis have taken root in forest areas of the new lands where they are able to find every living essence needed for experimentation. Their villages are sculpted into the majestic trees and their strange and wonderful gardens are a marvel to behold. They seek to rebuild their majestic kingdom of the ancient lands devastated during the kitin war, but their own intrigues often consume all their energy as each family vies for the crown. Further to this, in their natural concern for environmental quality they forever strive to perfect their knowledge of botany to better nurture plant life to prevent it ever waning.\n
	\n
	HISTORY\n
	\n
	Early Matis tribes, settling around the wooded region of Matia, came together to form a community headed by tribe leaders. But decision making was slow and quarrelsome leading to discontent among the people. Soon the physically imposing and charismatic leader, Zachini, emerged rallying enough support from prominent community members to step forward as sole leader. The monarchy was born. It was under Zachini rule that the Momos, primitive tribes, were hunted to extermination under the pretext that the inferior creatures menaced the living space of the Matis peoples. The Matis quickly extended their dominions to the extremities of the forest lands where they were kept in check by the Fyros whose audacious emperor, Dyros the Great, secured a water route from the lake lands to the desert through Matis territory. This 'intrusion' on Matis territory triggered the start of the war of civilizations.\n
	\n
	The intermittent skirmishes went on for over two hundred years coming to a head with the Fire of Coriolis. A great inferno spread across Fyros wastelands preventing Fyros reinforcements from rallying to the defence of outposts positioned along the water route. The Matis king, Aniro III, took advantage of the diversion created by the fire to send in his armies to isolate and capture the Fyros military outposts. They were then able to overrun the lake lands of the Trykers who consequently fell into Matis slavery. But Matis domination was short lived as Fyros reprisals and Tryker rebellion soon made the aristocratic warriors resort back to a defensive strategy to retain their former dominions.\n
	\n
	Another incident some two generations later led the Matis to enact a similar scenario. The great swarming of kitins that first hit Fyros lands allowed the Matis to again take possession of the water route and rout Fyros garrisons. Again their demise was as quick as their ascension as kitin armies piled through Matis dominions in waves eradicating all traces of hominkind in their path.\n
	\n
	HOW THEY SEE:\n
	\n
	The Karavan\n
	The Matis willingly see the Karavan as faithful servants of Jena who collect resources as offerings for the goddess to prepare for the future on a planet of fresh woodlands and pastures new. But most of all, they see them as a useful ally whose arms of power they would all too gladly learn to wield.\n
	\n
	The Kamis\n
	They are suspicious of these creatures who are opposed to their Karavan Guardians. What is more, the Kamis condemn Matis genetic manipulation of plant life.\n
	\n
	Elias Tryton\n
	Some witnessed the 'apparition' of Elias who appeared in a shaft of light from the canopy. Elders claim he is in fact a messenger of Jena who sent him to allow them to take refuge in the Prime Roots from kitin onslaughts of some three generations ago.]

uiAppear_Infos_Tryker	[THE TRYKER CIVILIZATION\n
	\n
	The Trykers, probably the greatest seafarers of the ancient world, lived in floating villages in the lake lands known as Trykoth. Their principle cities are all ports, including Jeniah and Breneth. Shorter of stature than the other homin races, the Trykers are wily hedonists, skilled in wind technology and form a federation of tribes more than a single people. They love travel and adventure, delighting in all the good things in life, but no matter how far they stray, they will always return to their home. The other civilizations are wary of their 'flighty' nature and some see them as nothing more than wayward brigands full of bravado. But their fighting spirit is not to be underestimated, they are excellent shots and have learnt to take full advantage of their natural agility.\n
	\n
	The Trykers nurture an egalitarian dream of a world without tyranny or intolerance, with neither masters nor slaves. Furthermore, in their penchant for conservationism, which has led them to develop the technique of water purification, they continue to look on water not only for its biological value but seek to use it for energetic ends.\n
	\n
	HISTORY\n
	\n
	The Trykers' peaceful and idyllic existence became blighted when a great fire, known as the Fire of Coriolis, spread across Atys wastelands to the north so cutting off the water route between desert and lake lands as well as their Fyros protectors. Taking advantage of the calamity in the north to break the Fyro-Tryker alliance, the Matis king, Aniro III, led a lightening campaign to the south invading lake lands and easily reducing surviving Trykers to slavery. But an organized fellowship of rebels led by Loria broke away and took refuge in the depths of Atys.\n
	\n
	Traveling underground through the Prime Roots, these Tryker heroes strove to shatter the shackles binding their brothers and led them across the Bark of Atys braving the worst of dangers. At the same time, realising that without water supplies from the lake lands his empire would crumble, the then aged Abylus the Learned, launched an all out attack on the Matis front in an attempt to re-establish the water route running through Matis territory to the Lake Lands. Matis forces thus engaged in all out warfare were unable to quell the revolt led by the Company of Loria who led their people back to the Lake Lands. Loria masterly divided her people into combat groups, each one led by a member of the Company to exert repeated alternating attacks along the southern front so creating havoc and relieving flagging Fyros forces in the north and west. Faced with Fyro-Tryker pressure, Aniro III eventually took the decision to retreat back to his dominions rather than risk losing them completely.\n
	\n
	The water route was open again and, wiser after the battle, the Trykers further developed their newfound guerrilla skills in case of future attack. And indeed, barely two generations later the Matis, taking advantage of a swarming of kitins in the desert regions which decimated Fyros populations, again turned their eyes to the west and south. However, the Trykers were saved from feeling the full force of the Matis by the kitin onslaughts which destroyed many of the invade Matis before moving into the Tryker lands.\n
	\n
	HOW THEY SEE:\n
	\n
	The Karavan\n
	The Karavan stand watch over hominkind and assure their security in case the Dragon rises or any other nefarious entity menaces the land. But since the Great Swarming most Trykers have come to started to privately feel that the Karavan have not entirely lived up to their role as Guardians.\n
	\n
	The Kamis\n
	These strange and powerful entities are essentially good as they love and take care of the environment. Indeed, it is said that the earliest Trykers were favorites of the Kamis. For generations they dawdled in the paradise of Atys at one with the Kamis until the day the Fyros began ravishing the Bark and liberating fire. As a consequence, in need of calm and healing, the Kamis grew closer to the Zoraïs.\n
	\n
	Elias Tryton\n
	 Tryker elders relate how Elias, a man all in white, came down before a chosen few in a great light to guide them to safety through a rainbow. The surviving 'chosen ones' would have Trykers believe that Elias is none other than the husband of Jena, in which case, it would turn out that Elias is the divine father of Atys! ]

uiAppear_Infos_Zorai	[THE ZORAI CIVILIZATION\n
	\n
	With a natural penchant for the sublime, over the centuries the Zoraïs have grown close to the mysterious Kami entities who they regard as higher disciples of Jena, the Goddess of Atys. They proudly wear the Kami mask of kinship genetically sown into their faces, distinguishing them from other homins. Zoraï society was previously structured around magnificent magnetic temple-cities where grand ceremonies were orchestrated to parry the flora devouring goo cancer which the Kamis were powerless to repel themselves. Since the devastating swarming of kitins, the surviving Zoraïs have once again expressly chosen their new sites in the middle of the enchanting jungle where the goo is rife. The Zoraïs have mastered the manipulation of magic magnetic fields which they use in the fabrication of weaponry and buildings. The Zoraïs not only seek to restore the magnificence of their former dynasty but are keen to promote spiritual awareness throughout the newfound lands. What is more, their innate proclivity for ecology pushes them on more than ever in their crusade against polluting phenomena such as the goo.\n
	\n
	HISTORY\n
	\n
	The first Zoraïs were a mysterious group of peoples who lived in the ancient jungles in the region known as Zoran south of the river Ti-aïn. It is not known exactly when the Zoraïs settled in the area but it was probably somewhere between 2199 and 2205. The first Zoraïs set up camp in the jungle where a tribe of them came into contact with Kami entities which they came to look upon as disciples of Jena, their Goddess. Given to mysticism, the Zoraïs built up mysterious cities centered around temples to Jena. The goo infested area they had claimed was not prized by other peoples and their civilization was able to quickly expand becoming a force to be reckoned with. Led by a dynasty of spiritual chieftains, they were able to annex jungle land easily fending off sporadic Fyros attacks on their impregnable temple cities.\n
	\n
	Under the Cho dynasty they undertook a campaign of territorial expansion to house their ever increasing populations. They began to set up settlements to the north nearer to other homin civilizations. On witnessing what they saw as barbarous acts of cruelty they began the construction of a great wall delimiting their territory to preserve peace and harmony within and to keep undesirables out. This policy enabled them to steer clear of futile and soul destroying acts of violence and to keep out of the scourge of interracial warfare that continuously ravaged the ancient lands.\n
	\n
	In the cover of their vast protected provinces, they were able to develop a form of writing and gave themselves over to spiritual enlightenment. However, in 2481, under the authority of Min-Cho, the great dynasty crumbled like a house of cards with the kitin onslaughts which, in their self-imposed segregation, the Zoraïs were powerless to counter.\n
	\n
	HOW THEY SEE:\n
	\n
	The Karavan\n
	 The Zoraïs see the Karavan as disciples of the initial teachings of Jena which did not account for the presence of the goo, hence the unreasonable Karavan interdictions regarding certain areas of the planet where the goo is thought to take its source.\n
	\n
	The Kamis\n
	The Zoraïs believe that, created after the Karavan by Jena, the Kamis are the living embodiment of pure energy on Atys and must at all costs be protected. They believe themselves to be the chosen children of the Kamis because among the homins it is they who have most retained the pure energy. The Zoraïs may return to a state of 'purity' through Kamis worship and by endeavoring to keep as much pure energy as possible from leaking from their bodies as well as Atys.\n
	\n
	Elias Tryton\n
	The apparition of Elias is a manifestation of a great Kamis. He appeared in a halo of light some three generations ago to a chosen few to tell them how to lead homins from the kitin reign of terror through the rainbow to the relative safety of the Prime Roots. ]

	21. PRÉCAUTIONS À PRENDRE / ÉPILEPSIE. Winch Gate vous rappelle qu'il est nécessaire d'éviter de jouer si vous êtes fatigué ou si vous manquez de sommeil. Assurez-vous que vous jouez dans une pièce bien éclairée en modérant la luminosité de votre écran. Lorsque vous utilisez un jeu vidéo susceptible d'être connecté à un écran, jouez à bonne distance de cet écran de télévision et aussi loin que le permet le cordon de raccordement. En cours d'utilisation, faites des pauses de dix à quinze minutes toutes les heures.

Ces personnes s'exposent à des crises lorsqu'elles jouent à certains jeux vidéo comportant de telles stimulations, alors même qu'elles n'ont pas d'antécédent médical ou n'ont jamais été sujettes elles-mêmes à des crises d'épilepsie. Si vous-même ou un membre de votre famille avez déjà présenté des symptômes liés à l'épilepsie (crise ou perte de conscience) en présence de stimulations lumineuses, consultez votre médecin avant toute utilisation. Les parents se doivent également d'être particulièrement attentifs à leurs enfants lorsqu'ils jouent avec des jeux vidéo. Si vous-même ou votre enfant présentez un des symptômes suivants : vertige, trouble de la vision, contraction des yeux ou des muscles, trouble de l'orientation, mouvement involontaire ou convulsion, perte momentanée de conscience, il faut cesser immédiatement de jouer et consulter un médecin.\n

uiTryton1	[For many centuries I have voyaged through the quiescent corridors of Ryzom. I bore witness to the Green Rising of Atys, and the birth of hominkind.  I witnessed their striving for survival in a merciless world of killing   plants and swarming beasts. Worse, entrenched in their brutish ignorance    they gave themselves to bloodshed in their vying for power with their own kin.     Thus weakened by interracial warfare and bound to their territories in      their self-imposed segregation, they fell victim to a terrible swarming of kitins.]

uiTryton2	[Even the great Atysian forces of the Kami and the Karavan put together were powerless against the kitin onslaughts in that calamitous year. Entire populations perished. When the dreadful  news came to my ears, I did not delay in giving all the assistance I could to save the last   survivors, many of whom had dispersed and fled into the wilderness. ]

uiTryton3	[Three generations have since passed for healing wounds, rebuilding lives, for introspection and rekindling the spirit of hominkind. The time has now come for  the wise and the brave to take up the reins of ambition, to blaze the trail   to a new order, to span the rifts between continents and forge the destinies    of their civilizations.]

uiTryton4	[This is my one hope, for in unity will we best be armed to repel the tide of advancing evil. Certainly, I already hear the ominous rumblings of the Mega Corp that, alas, shall one day  rock the very bowels of the green planet.\n
	But I have faith yet in this, the New Beginning of Mankind\n
	\n
