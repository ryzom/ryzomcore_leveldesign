uiAppear_Infos_Fyros	[THE FYROS CIVILIZATION\n
	\n
	Truth, honor and discipline are the values prized by every true born Fyros! We are the champions of the desert who stand by a strict code of honor. We are the warriors of knowledge who vow never to retreat in our quest for the truth behind the Dragon of the Myth. Neither the Law of Jena nor Karavan prohibitions will stop us from delving down into the bowels of Atys where we have uncovered as many mysterious relics as evils.\n
	\n
	We are the protectors of the more fertile regions. For we are the only ones brave enough to rebuild our towns in the scorching desert where the Dragon is most likely to resurface.\n
	\n
	From these hostile dunes we shall shape our new Empire, make it strong, and build our alliance with the Kamis whose magic we are proud to wield. We also aspire to further develop our knowledge of the fabrication of fire-toughened tools and weaponry to help in our conquest of the truth.\n
	\n
	If you're keen and just, come join our ranks, homin. An Empire needs you!!\n
	\n
	Now, if you've got any questions...\n
	\n
	\n
	Who am I?\n
	You are a young homin refugee. You have bravely taken the long and perilous journey from the old lands to these new lands where we have begun building our new Empire. Once you've got enough training behind you, you'll be able to put your skills to good use for our Emperor and help rebuild our civilization.\n
	\n
	Who are my ancestors?\n
	By sword and fire, your ancestors forged the most powerful empire in history. Honor their memory as long as you live! But the fruit of their labor was destroyed by great invasions of kitins. They were lucky to escape the massacres. After some time we found a new region, called the New Lands, to rebuild the Empire. It took many years of blood and sweat to build the foundations of our new Empire after the First Swarming, and it was nearly taken down again in 2562 with the Second Swarming. Your generation must now build it up. Your parents showed great courage in urging you to take the long road to join your own people here in these New Lands. Now that you have found us you must live up to their courage.\n
	\n
	Who is our chief?\n
	Lykos is our lawful Emperor; you owe him your allegiance. His orders can only be debated in higher spheres. Until you have gained enough rank you will not contest them, never forget it, young homin! You will carry out imperial orders with success or you will die trying, unless you will willingly tarnish the name of your ancestors. Lykos has chosen the best to counsel him; Dios Apotheps, Lyan Cexius and Ibiphan Dynix are his senators.\n
	\n
	What do we believe in?\n
	We believe in the energy of Atys, the energy that fills every being with life and conscience. According to the Zoraïs, the Kamis are a manifestation of that great energy that created the world which they call Ma-Duk. Though we refuse blind adherence to their teachings, over these last years we have become closer to the Kamis to escape Karavan sanctions for mining and underground exploration. To the Kamis we owe, if not our faith, our loyalty.\n
	\n
	What are our values?\n
	Your life must be built upon the four pillars that uphold our Empire:\n
	Truth is the first pillar.\n
	Cowardly lies will not deceive the cut and thrust of battle! Tell nothing but the truth to your comrades, just as they must give straightforward answers to your questions. Do not hesitate, however, to use the art of cunning in the face of the enemy. Stratagem used wisely is as dangerous a weapon as a sharp spear held firmly in hand!\n
	Honor is the second pillar.\n
	Let yourself be guided by honor no matter what. Never stoop to the minor sentiments, no matter how high the potential gain. And remember, an honorable death is better than a cowardly existence.\n
	Discipline is the third pillar.\n
	The Fyros Empire exists thanks to the chain of obedience that links us to the Emperor, from the youngest novice to the most celebrated general. Each and every one of us must show obedience to higher command. Just one insubordinate Fyros is enough to break the link and so threaten the whole Empire.\n
	Justice is the fourth pillar.\n
	The Emperor is our absolute chief, though even he must scrupulously obey the laws decreed by our ancestors. From the most powerful to the most humble, we respect our laws without compromise. In truth, then, it is not the Imperial Chief but the Imperial Law that dictates our conduct.\n
	\n
	What are our prohibitions?\n
	- Never be tempted to do favors for the Karavan. They are against the Kamis and against our sense of justice. Indeed, they place their Jena Law above social justice.\n
	- Never carry out a mission for the Karavan.\n
	- Never carry out a mission for the enemy tribes.\n
	- Never violate the code of honor.\n
	\n
	What are our goals?\n
	Our empire suffered greatly from the Great Swarming. Our sense of discipline has allowed us to survive much better than the Matis or the Trykers, our great city of Pyr is proof. We must now:\n
	- develop our individual strengths and skills\n
	- form powerful and well-structured guilds to build up a driving force\n
	- discover the truth behind the dragon\n
	- fight against the Karavan to impose a new order around the Kami\n
	- gather the knowledge that was scattered throughout the land during the Great Swarming to open the doors to the secrets of the past.\n
	- consolidate and conquer more territory.\n
	\n
	Who are our friends?\n
	Since the Peace Treaty signed at Fairhaven, we have been at peace with the other homin peoples. Nevertheless, the past has left us with many scars as tokens of past instability, and our relations vary depending on the civilizations.\n
	Zoraï: Over the years the Zoraïs have proved time again their loyalty and friendship towards our people. What is more, we both hold the Kamis in our hearts and share a deep aversion for the Karavan.\n
	Tryker: Time and again we have tried to take the Tryker under our protective wing, but they have proven too chaotic and too flighty for lasting friendship. Nowadays, we must be careful of the fickle little homins, for more than ever they have stepped in line with the Matis in their veneration of the Karavan goddess.\n
	Matis: The Matis are our inherent enemy not to be trusted. We do not adhere to the Matis sense of justice which centers around the monarchy and Jena Law. Even in these times of peace we must stand vigil lest they team up against us.\n
	Friendly tribes include: The Root Tappers, Kitin Gatherers, Pyromancers, Watchers, Frahar Hunters, Water Breakers, First Deserters, Slash and Burn, Oasis Diggers, Sacred Sap.\n
	\n
	Who are our enemies?\n
	- The Karavan: They are against us digging down for the truth. They are not to be trusted.\n
	- The Kitins: These gigantic insects massacred many thousands of Fyros and devastated our great Empire in the old lands.\n
	- The Dragon of the myth: For centuries we have been in search of the truth behind the Dragon of legend. It is our digging down into the bowels of Atys where the dragon is said to slumber that first brought Karavan retribution down upon us. We shall dig on till the truth is uncovered.\n
	- Enemy tribes include: The Sap Gleaners, Cockroaches, Chlorogoos, Lawless, Scorchers, Renegades, Lagoon Brothers, Tutors, Ancient Dryads.\n
	- Bandits: Beware, the lands are full of outlaws, thieves and cutthroats.\n
	- Animal predators: There are many predators in the animal kingdom, watch out they are not impartial to a bit of homin flesh!\n
	\n
	How can I help my people?\n
	We need crafters, harvesters, magicians and warriors to maintain and make our civilization stronger.\n
	- Atys is a treacherous place, we need warriors to defend our territory and conquer new lands for new settlements.\n
	- We want crafters to produce everyday objects and weapons; and harvesters to gather the raw materials for food and manufacture.\n
	- We need magicians to enchant crafted items, protect harvesters, and heal warriors in combat and help them fight.\n
	\n
	What can I expect of my people?\n
	- Training from our expert trainers.\n
	- Our people are defended by guilds who may come to your aide once you've joined one.\n
	- The more you act for the good of our people the more your deeds of valor will be rewarded.\n
	\n
	What is our new land?\n
	Our people first settled on these desert lands in 2483 on their resurfacing from the newfound land Prime Roots. The desert is the toughest region of all though this has always been the challenge equal to our courage and the values of our people. From 2487 our numbers were continually increased by refugees until 2562, when the Second Swarming forced us once more to flee for our lives. Now we are back at the desert lands, and you have joined us following the road from the old lands, the road you have courageously taken.\n
	What can I expect from Atys, our world?\n
	Atys is abounding with raw materials, young homin. As long as you respect the environment you will reap many a reward from her bosom. As you become skilled in the ways of the world you will learn to tame the wilderness and conquer new grounds.]

uiAppear_Infos_Matis	[THE MATIS CIVILIZATION\n
	\n
	A Matis must possess the more noble traits of hominkind. A Matis must be loyal, courteous, tenacious, and most of all, reverent. By obeying our king, we are glorifying Jena, our Goddess, who bestowed on him the divine right. We believe that just as every particle of Jena's universe has a function, every homin must strive for her or his true place in society.\n
	\n
	Jena helps those who help themselves, a Matis must never give in. By striving for success we are making our civilization strong as a whole. Only the best can reach the higher spheres of our society, only the elite can lead our people on.\n
	\n
	By manipulating nature we are elevating our souls nearer to godliness. Indeed, homin, it is by no mere coincidence that we have become the Atysian Master Manipulators of plant and animal life. Our weaponry, armor and even familiar household items are living objects!\n
	\n
	We have taken root in the forest areas of the new lands where we find every living essence needed for experimentation. We now need to make our new kingdom stronger and better, in the name of Jena.\n
	\n
	If noble blood runs through your veins, come swear allegiance to your King! Our kingdom needs winners!!\n
	\n
	Come now, homin, if you have any questions...\n
	\n
	\n
	Who am I?\n
	You are a young homin refugee. You have taken the long and perilous journey from the old lands to these new lands where we have established our new realm. After a period of training, as a loyal subject to the king you will be able to put your skills to good use and help rebuild our Kingdom.\n
	\n
	Who are my ancestors?\n
	Your forefathers back at the Old Lands, built the most glorious kingdom on all Atys. But our lands and our capital, Matia, were destroyed by kitins in 2481 in a terrible swarming. Your ancestors escaped to the forests where they lived a harsh life under constant threat from kitins. They managed to find a new region they called the New Lands, where they rebuilt our glorious Kingdom. In 2562, a new swarming of Kitins forced us to flee once more. After several years in the exile, for your own good, your parents urged you to take the great road to join your people here in the New Lands. You have found us; we have secured the territory once more, and we will keep shaping our Kingdom as we did before. It is up to your generation to live up to our former glory and make our civilization majestic again.\n
	\n
	Who is our chief?\n
	King Stevano. He is our supreme lord after Jena. To him you owe your absolute loyalty. To challenge his authority is to oppose Jena, a heresy worthy of death. If you are honored enough to be assigned a royal mission, you must succeed with dignity, unless you willingly defy his divine authority. You must strive to become worthy of his trust and you too may gain rank. Rodi di Varello, Mephyros Xytis, Kellen Codgan, Libi Freldo are the faithful dukes that give him counsel.\n
	\n
	What is our faith?\n
	Jena is our Goddess, we must abide by her Law as it is preached to us by her faithful disciples, the Karavan. They watch over us lest we stray from the right path. They allow us to give offerings and render services to her to prepare for the future in the world of promise beyond. Remember, young homin, the Karavan are invested with great power which they will share only with the faithful. It is your duty to seek Jena's favor through dealings with her disciples and you too will learn to wield their technology.\n
	\n
	What are our values?\n
	To succeed as a true Matis, you must build your life on the three key values:\n
	- Loyalty to King and Jena: The king holds power through divine right, his enemies are your enemies, by defending our religion you are defending our kingdom. In the same way, by disobeying him and his court you are disrespecting Jena, and are therefore guilty of heresy.\n
	- Aesthetic achievement: Our culture will have nothing but the best, we honor our goddess by making things beautiful as she made us noble.\n
	- Competition: We believe that every Matis must strive for his or her true place in society. Competition is what strengthens our character, sorts out the weak from the strong. And we Matis fight to win!\n
	\n
	What are our prohibitions?\n
	- It is strictly forbidden to approach the Kamis (unless ordered to do so by the Karavan). They are evil demons and are against the Karavan.\n
	- Never breach the Law of Jena.\n
	- Do not wander beneath the surface of Atys, you will be in danger of waking the dreaded dragon of the apocalypse.\n
	- Never carry out missions for enemy tribes.\n
	- It is forbidden to spread dragon fire over the lands. It devours the trees and deprives us of essences necessary for our creations.\n
	\n
	What are our goals?\n
	After resurfacing from the Prime Roots, our greatest challenge was to tame this land and make it noble. Our town and settlements sculpted from the very trees are living proof of our success. Now we must:\n
	- develop our individual strengths and skills\n
	- build strong and loyal guilds to spread the word of Jena among the infidels and free the world of Kami possession\n
	- further our knowledge to make even better tools and weapons. During the Great Swarming, much knowledge was scattered throughout the land. Discovering this knowledge and more will open the doors to the secrets of the past.\n
	\n
	Who are our friends?\n
	Since the Peace Treaty signed at Fairhaven in 2515, we have been at peace with the other homin peoples. But decades of peace can never erase the scars of past infamy. Indeed our relations vary depending on the civilization.\n
	Tryker: The past has taught us that the Trykers cannot be tamed, that they would sell their souls to the demons just to maintain their lifestyle. So be it; in the name of Jena we have learnt to live as indulgent friends rather than have them side with the infidels. Thanks to Jena our friendship has never been stronger, even though their fervor often leaves a lot to be desired.\n
	Zoraï: The Zoraïs are infidels and their paganism ought to be checked. Even so, it was a Zoraï warrior who saved the present king's father. With all due respect, many of us resent this 'debt' to the Zoraïs which tarnishes our credibility in the eyes of the Karavan. It is preferable that this does not happen again.\n
	Fyros: The Fyros are our inherent enemy who, over the past decades, have moved closer and closer to the evil Kamis. We mustn't forget that in the past they have succeeded in coaxing the Trykers to side with them against us. But the Fyros now prefer to side with the Zoraïs whose love for the Kami demon they share. However, we must remain vigilant lest they convert the Trykers with their blasphemous talk.\n
	Friendly tribes include: The Barkers, Frahar Hunters, Silt Sculptors, Renegades, Slavers, Icon Worshippers, Hamazans of the Dead Seed, Green Seed, Sap Slaves, Arid Matis, Darkening Sap, Kuilde.\n
	\n
	Who are our other enemies?\n
	- The Kamis: They are against us bringing order and beauty to the Jena's land. They are an evil scourge and ought to be stamped out.\n
	- The Kitins: These gigantic insects massacred many thousands of Matis and devastated our majestic kingdom in the lands of old.\n
	- Enemy tribes include: The Sap Gleaners, Cockroaches, Chlorogoos, Lawless, Scorchers, Lagoon Brothers, Tutors, Ancient Dryads, First Deserters, Slash and Burn, Woven Bridles.\n
	- Bandits: Watch out for outlaws, thieves and cutthroats that roam around the forests in search of easy prey.\n
	- Animal predators: Wild animals can be ferocious, many of them will attack homins on sight!\n
	\n
	How can I help my people?\n
	We are lacking crafters, harvesters, magicians and warriors to further expand our capabilities so we can keep ahead of the competition.\n
	- We need warriors to defend our territory and establish new living space.\n
	- We are in need of skilled crafters to produce everyday objects and weapons; and harvesters to gather the raw materials for food and manufacture.\n
	- We need magicians to enchant crafted items, protect harvesters, and heal warriors in combat and keep the enemy in check.\n
	\n
	What can I expect of my people?\n
	- Training from our expert trainers.\n
	- Our people are defended by guilds who may come to your aide once you've joined one.\n
	- The more you act for the good of our people the more you're noble deeds will be rewarded.\n
	\n
	What is our new land?\n
	Our people first took root in these wooded lands in 2483 on their resurfacing from the sanctuary of the Prime Roots in the new lands. The forest is by far the most beautiful place on Atys and to the keen eye offers every living essence needed for creation. Since 2487 we were continually rejoined by refugees  until 2562, when the Second Swarming forced us once more to flee for our lives. Now we are back at these wooded lands, and you have joined us following the road from the old lands, the road you have courageously taken.\n
	\n
	What can I expect from Atys, our world?\n
	Atys is a mine of fabulous natural riches, young homin, in time you will learn how to spin them into sellable wealth. As you become skilled in the ways of the world you will learn to tame the wilderness and conquer new grounds.]

uiAppear_Infos_Tryker	[THE TRYKER CIVILIZATION\n
	\n
	We Trykers live by the virtues of freedom, equality and sharing. We believe all homins are equal and should live and let live. We believe in nurturing the qualities of the individual, and not just the group as a whole. After all, our sweet Goddess Jena makes homins come into life one by one, not in elevens and nines! By favoring individual development and happiness, harmony and solidarity within the group follows, just as naturally as streams will come together to form a single river!\n
	\n
	Trykers are great travelers and explorers as well as experts in wind technology. Since the Great Swarming of kitins that destroyed our island cities in the ancient lands, we've made our homes in the new lake lands where we've laid down the foundations of our new Federation.\n
	\n
	If you believe in a world without tyranny or intolerance, with neither masters nor slaves, come help us build it!!\n
	\n
	You can pop your questions now...\n

	You're a young homin refugee. You've done well in taking the long and dangerous road from the old lands to join us here where we've set up our new home. Once you've got some training behind you, you'll be able to show us what you're made of and help us build up our federation of Tryker peoples.\n
	\n
	Who are my ancestors?\n
	Your ancestors built the most wonderful island cities in the Old Lands where they lived free as the wind. That was until five generations ago when the kitins came and wrought death and destruction throughout the land for the first time. Your ancestors escaped to the hills where they were brought up in the constant fear of kitin attack until they found a new region to start again, the New Lands. A generation ago, the Kitins swarmed again, and we were forced to run for our lives. it was a good thing your parents urged you to quit your dead-end life, and risk the great road to join us again in the New Lands. Now that you've found us, your new life can begin.\n
	\n
	Who is our chief?\n
	Lady Ailan Mac'kean, she's the big boss. She is the governor of the Tryker Council. When she speaks, you jump! At least until you've worked your way up to be able to speak to her eye to eye. You make sure you stand by her, young Homin, our independence depends on our solidarity! Her right-hand Homins are Shaley Nara and Denen Toen, they are experienced Homins and they provide her counsel. If ever you get the honor of carrying out a mission for the council, make sure you give it your best shot, you never know, our liberty could depend on it.\n
	\n
	What is our faith?\n
	Jena is our Goddess, she is the Mother of Creation. Many of our customs are centered around her worship. There's Thanksgiving Day, for example, it falls on the winter solstice to symbolize the return of light after the dark years that followed the Great Swarming. So that it doesn't happen again, we must live by her Law which is handed down to us by her faithful disciples, the Karavan. They watch over us and protect us from Kami possession. Remember, young homin, as long as you do as you're told and don't ruffle 'em, you too will be able to learn to wield their technology. Oh, and by the way; keep it under your hat, but some say that Elias is none other than the husband of Jena, which makes him the holy Father.  Don't mention that to the Karavan!\n
	\n
	What we value most?\n
	To be a true Tryker, you gotta live by the virtues of freedom, equality and sharing:\n
	- Freedom: Consider all homins responsible and free of their acts. Any homin violating the freedom of another will be in breach of the Homin Rights Act, which as it happens, was first drawn up by the Tryker Council.\n
	- Equality: Every homin has an equal right to walk the land, to obtain instruction, to harvest the natural resources, to choose their own destiny, as long as they don't encroach on other homin rights.\n
	- Sharing: We believe that our force lies in our solidarity and that solidarity is borne from sharing. If we could persuade all Jena's children to be like us Trykers the world would be a safer place!\n
	\n
	What are our prohibitions?\n
	- You must never make a pact or do a mission for the Kamis. They are evil demons and will possess your soul.\n
	- Never breach the Law of Jena.\n
	- Never carry out missions for enemy tribes.\n
	- If you venture down beneath the surface of Atys, be careful not to wake the dreaded dragon of the apocalypse.\n
	- It is forbidden to spread dragon fire over the lands. It makes the land sterile.\n
	\n
	What are our goals?\n
	Ever since we resurfaced from the Prime Roots we have been building solid foundations for our future civilization without tyranny or intolerance, where all Jena's children may live in freedom. Now we must:\n
	- develop our individual strengths and skills\n
	- build strong and closely knit guilds to spread the word of the Karavan and free the infidels of Kami possession\n
	- improve our knowledge to make even better tools and weapons. During the Great Swarming, much knowledge was scattered throughout the land. Discovering this knowledge and more will open the doors to the secrets of the past.\n
	\n
	Who are our friends?\n
	Since the Peace Treaty signed at Fairhaven in 2515, we have been at peace with the other homin peoples. But that don't stop us having our likes and dislikes.\n
	Matis: Despite past disputes and misunderstandings, the Matis now respect our freedom of thought and our right to build our society as we feel fit. After all, what really counts is that we share a faith in Jena. Thanks to Jena our friendship has never been stronger, especially since the Matis ratified the Homin Rights Act. What's more, to a certain extent the Matis owe us their freedom after the dictatorship of Jinovitch. Not only did the Tryker Council give Yrkanis political asylum in Fairhaven but Still Wyler - our former Governor - escorted him back into Matis lands to defeat Jinovitch to gain the throne.\n
	Fyros: The Fyros were once allies who exploited our need for protection by having us supply Fyros towns with merchandise at low cost. Since we've learnt to fight for ourselves we no longer need the patronizing Fyros protectors, especially with the new feeling of fraternity with the Matis. And besides, the Fyros have gotten closer to the Kamis.\n
	Zoraï: The Zoraïs are not to be trusted, they openly breach Jena Law by venerating the Kamis. What's more, during the Great Swarming in the old lands, the Zoraïs refused to let us through their great wall and let many thousands of Trykers perish in the jaws of the kitins. More recently, it was the Zoraïs who first installed slavery in the new lands.\n
	Friendly tribes include: The Frahar Hunters, Silt Sculptors, Corsairs, Beachcombers, Shadow Runners, Green Seed, Slash and Burn, Ecowarriors, Oasis Diggers, Kuilde.\n
	\n
	Who are our other enemies?\n
	- The Kamis: They are an evil blight, they try to blow your mind with their magic just to possess you. They ought to be stamped out.\n
	- The Kitins: These gigantic insects massacred many thousands of Trykers and devastated our wonderful floating cities in the old lands of Trykoth.\n
	- The Dragon: It has never been seen, but we know it's lurking deep down in the bowels of Atys somewhere. There's not much we can do about it though, best put it to the back of the mind.\n
	- Enemy tribes include: The Sap Gleaners, Chlorogoos, Lawless, Lagoon Brothers, Slavers, Tutors, Ancient Dryads, Woven Bridles, Darkening Sap.\n
	- Bandits: Better watch out for outlaws, thieves and cutthroats, they get all over the place.\n
	- Animal predators: There are lots of real nasty animals on Atys, make sure you watch your step if you don't wanna end up as their dinner!\n
	\n
	How can I help my people?\n
	Well, it's simple, whether you're a crafter, harvester, magician or a warrior, we need you!\n
	- We need warriors to defend our territorial rights and support our need for growth.\n
	- We need able crafters to produce everyday objects and weapons; and harvesters to gather the raw materials for food and manufacture.\n
	- We need magicians to enchant crafted items, protect harvesters, and heal warriors in combat and keep the enemy in check.\n
	\n
	What can I expect of my people?\n
	- Training from our expert trainers.\n
	- Our people are defended by guilds who may come to your aide once you've joined one.\n
	- The more you act for the good of our people the more your brilliant deeds will be rewarded.\n
	\n
	What is our new land?\n
	Our people first made our home in the lake lands in 2483 on our resurfacing from the Prime Roots to the New Lands. The lakes are the most magical place on Atys though you gotta be quick cause it certainly ain't no place for weak knees! Since 2487 we were continually rejoined by refugees until 2562, when the Second Swarming forced us once more to run away for our lives. Nowadays, we are back at the lake lands, and you have joined us following the road from the old lands, the road you have courageously taken.\n
	\n
	What can I expect from Atys, our world?\n
	Atys is a mine of fabulous natural riches, young homin In time you'll learn how to make a good living out of them.\n
	As you become skilled in the ways of the world you will learn how the land lies to be able to move into new grounds.]

uiAppear_Infos_Zorai	[THE ZORAÏ CIVILIZATION\n
	\n
	Our society rests on the attainment of spiritual accomplishment, wisdom and the respect of nature. Over the centuries we have built up a relationship with the Kamis, divine entities sent by Ma-Duk, the Creator of Atys. We proudly wear the Kami mask of kinship which distinguishes us from homin races of weaker spiritual substance.\n
	\n
	We have searched for knowledge where others have searched for personal gain. We were the first to write down the spoken word so that the knowledge of our ancestors could prevail. Our society became structured around magnificent temple-cities where grand ceremonies were orchestrated to deflect the flora-devouring cancer of the Goo which the Kamis were powerless to repel themselves.\n
	\n
	Since the devastating swarming of kitins, we have once again expressly chosen our new sites in the middle of the enchanting jungle where pollution of the Goo is rife.\n
	\n
	Now we seek to recover the magnificence of our former dynasty and make it shine as a beacon of wisdom. We are keen to share spiritual awareness throughout the world so that all hominkind may attain eternal bliss.\n
	\n
	If you consider that there is more to life than meets the eye, then we need you!!\n
	\n
	Ask your questions now, and put your mind at rest...\n
	\n
	\n
	Who am I?\n
	You are a young homin refugee. You have wisely responded to the calling of your people in taking the long and perilous journey from the old lands. For the last decades we have been rebuilding the foundations of our society in these new lands of promise, we need your help. After a period of training, you will be able to put your skills to good use and help rebuild our civilization.\n
	\n
	Who are my ancestors?\n
	Your ancestors built a society structured around magnetic temple-cities where grand ceremonies were orchestrated for spiritual enlightenment. It is up to your generation now to rekindle that flame, to make our civilization shine again as the true spiritual leader. Your ancestors took refuge from the kitin onslaughts of 2481, until they found this New Land to start again. But the Kitins came back once more at 2562. You were brought up in the wilds, but the exile is over and your parents did right in urging you to quit your hapless life and take the great road to join the rest of your people. You have traveled for many years but now you have found us. Your new life has just begun.\n
	\n
	Who is our chief?\n
	Mabreka, the Great Sage, is our spiritual leader. Where he leads, you must follow, his aura shines like a beacon in the night and guides our souls. Follow his light and you too will shine among your people. Consider it a great honor if you are chosen to carry out a mission on his demand, the outcome will illustrate your worthiness. Supplice, Sens and Season are the Sages that, having attained merit, give him guidance.\n
	\n
	What is our faith?\n
	We worship the superior life energy which created Atys; he is called Ma-Duk. Ma-Duk manifests his presence on Atys through the Kamis who watch over his creation. Remember, homin, the Kamis must be protected, it is through them that you will gain merit to accede to full enlightenment. Give them offerings and do them favors whenever you can, and they will impart their magic to you.\n
	\n
	What do we value?\n
	To be fully reborn as a true Zoraï you must structure your new life on the fundamental cornerstones of wisdom, spiritual accomplishment and respect of nature.\n
	- Wisdom: To better serve the Kamis it is important you learn about yourself, your people and about Atys. By gaining knowledge you will also learn how to better defend Atys, the Kamis and your people against barbarity.\n
	- Spiritual accomplishment: You must seek to gain merit for your soul to reach enlightenment. For this you must not only fortify your individual relationship with the Kamis but also spread the word of Kamis enlightenment to other homins so they too may share the ultimate bliss.\n
	- Respect of nature: Our culture is built on a deep respect for nature. You must guard against over-exploitation and fire, and at all costs fight against the Goo which the Kamis are powerless to repel.\n
	\n
	What are our prohibitions?\n
	- You must never have dealings with the Karavan. They are the enemy of the Kamis and try to stop us in our task of eradicating the Goo. By gathering raw materials for the Karavan, you will be guilty of raping the planet we have been made to cherish. The Karavan are responsible for the gradual depletion of resources and environmental damage.\n
	- Never mock or oppose the Kamis. The Kamis act for the good of Atys.\n
	- It is forbidden to spread fire over the lands. It strips the land of its wealth and leaves it sterile.\n
	- Never carry out missions for enemy tribes.\n
	\n
	What are our goals?\n
	For the last decades we have been diligently building the bases of our civilization to build from. Now we must:\n
	- develop our individual strengths and skills\n
	- make our dynasty shine and promote spiritual awareness throughout the newfound lands centered around Kami worship\n
	- build strong guilds to free hominkind from the influence of the Karavan. Then we may all join forces in our crusade against the Goo to make this world a better place\n
	- retrieve the knowledge lost during the Great Swarming. If you discover this knowledge you will be able to open the doors to the secrets of the past.\n
	\n
	Who are our friends?\n
	Since the Peace Treaty signed at Fairhaven in 2515, we have been at peace with the other homin peoples. But ten years of peace could never erase the many years of barbarity that was rife in other homin lands. We still find that some homins have more merit than others.\n
	Fyros: The Fyros are brash, though valiant, warriors who in recent times have proved worthy of our trust. They have been making good progress in their spiritual development and have clearly chosen the way of the Kamis.\n
	Tryker: The minds of the Trykers have not yet evolved sufficiently to be able to accept Kami enlightenment. They are of little spiritual worth. Not only are they said to have treated the Kamis with frivolity in the past, but they venerate the Karavan who are hostile to the Kamis.\n
	Matis: We must try to free the Matis from the influence of the Karavan and bring them round to the Kami way of living. This is why, in 2509, Yrkanis, the father of the present Matis king, was given refuge in Zora and helped to muster an army to depose the ultra-Karavan monarch Jinovitch and install a more tolerant government. This was the first step to coax the Matis into the Kami world.\n
	Friendly tribes include: The Barkers, Dune Riders, Beachcombers, Icon Worshippers, Tutors, Hamazans of the Dead Seed, Ecowarriors, Oasis Diggers, Sacred Sap, Siblings of the Weeds.\n
	\n
	Who are our other enemies?\n
	- The Karavan: They are hostile to the Kamis, and among the weaker minds have imposed blind adherence to their goddess, Jena. Our forefathers, and more recently, the Fyros, managed to break away from their hold. We must help the other peoples to do likewise.\n
	- The Kitins: These gigantic insects massacred many thousands of Zoraïs and devastated our dynasty in the lands of old.\n
	- The Goo: This is a cancer to our planet. It offends the Kamis and must be eradicated.\n
	- Enemy tribes include: The Cockroaches, Chlorogoos, Lawless, Scorchers, Lagoon Brothers, Masters of the Goo, Antikamis, Goo Heads, Woven Bridles, Darkening Sap.\n
	- Bandits: Beware of outlaws, thieves and cutthroats, young homin. They won't spare your life if there's any profit to be had.\n
	- Animal predators: The jungle is home to many wild animals, many of them will attack homins on sight!\n
	\n
	How can I help my people?\n
	To be able to build our temple cities and play our role as spiritual leaders of Atys, we must be strong enough to resist opposition. For this we must recruit more crafters, harvesters, magicians and warriors.\n
	- We need warriors to defend our territory and establish new centers for kami worship.\n
	- We need crafters to produce everyday objects and weapons; and harvesters to gather the raw materials for food and manufacture.\n
	- We need magicians to enchant crafted items, protect harvesters, and heal warriors in combat and keep the enemy in check.\n
	\n
	What can I expect of my people?\n
	- Training from our expert trainers.\n
	- Our people are defended by guilds who may come to your aide once you've joined one.\n
	- The more you act for the good of our people the more you're noble deeds will be rewarded.\n
	\n
	What is our new land?\n
	After resurfacing from the Prime Roots of the new lands in 2483, we secured new sites in the middle of the jungle where the Kamis most need us. The jungle is the most enchanted place on Atys, but one that needs caring for, it is here that the Goo is most rife. Since 2487 we were continually rejoined by refugees until 2562, when the Second Swarming forced us once more to flee for our lives. Now we are back at the jungle, and you have joined us following the road from the old lands, the road you have courageously taken.\n
	\n
	What can I expect from Atys, our world?\n
	Atys offers a wealth of natural riches, young homin, you may help yourself to further your development provided that you respect the environment. If you don't, the Kamis will be down on you like thunder!\n
	As you become skilled in the ways of the world you will learn the lay of the land, an all important rite of passage if you are to lay claim to new territory, homin.]

	\n
	A NOTICE TO THE USER: THIS DOCUMENT IS A CONTRACT. BEFORE CLICKING ON THE "I ACCEPT" BUTTON BELOW AND COMPLETING THE INSTALLATION OR REGISTRATION PROCEDURE, PLEASE READ IT CAREFULLY. WHEN YOU CLICK ON "I ACCEPT", YOU ARE ACCEPTING THE TERMS OF THIS CONTRACT AND THE OBLIGATIONS CONTAINED IN IT. IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO BE A PARTY TO THIS CONTRACT OR TO BE BOUND BY ALL OF ITS TERMS, THEN CLICK "CANCEL" AND DO NOT INSTALL THE SOFTWARE (OR UNINSTALL IT IF INSTALLED), AND DO NOT USE IT.\n
	ACCEPTING THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, YOU ALSO AGREE TO ABIDE BY THE CODE OF CONDUCT THAT YOU WILL FIND HERE: https://ryzom.com/terms-of-service\n
	If you have any difficulty in relation to this License, please contact Ryzom Customer Service at support@ryzom.com.\n
	\n
	1. OBJECT OF THE CONTRACT. This Ryzom License (from here on referred to as "the Contract") is a contract between you and Winch Gate Property Limited ("Winch Gate" or "We/us"). Its purpose is to establish the terms on which Winch Gate provides (as defined in Article 2 below) the following services to an authorized user in relation to the massively multiplayer on-line game Ryzom ("Ryzom" or "the Game" or "Ryzom Arkitect"). The services comprise the opening and maintenance of an account enabling the user to play the Game over the Internet and to use our ingame tool, Ryzom Arkitect, to create inside content for the game.\n
	\n
	2. AUTHORIZED USERS. Only natural persons who have reached their majority may open an account, either for their own use or for that of their underage children, enabling them to play Ryzom. If you are underage, then your parents must subscribe  create an account and accept the terms of this Contract. For the purposes of this Contract, an "underage" person is one who has not attained the age of legal majority in his/her country of residence. In addition, the only users authorized to play Ryzom are users who have a current free or subscribed access account. Authorized users are referred to below as "Users".\n
	\n
	3. REGISTERING AND OPENING AN ACCOUNT. This Contract allows you to use the procedure offered for registering your details to set up one (1) account enabling you to play Ryzom and/or Ryzom Arkitect over the Internet. The Internet connection is not provided by Winch Gate, and the User is solely responsible for payment of all charges enabling him/her to obtain, maintain and use the connection. Registration requires you to send information to Winch Gate, including information on your identity and the means of payment used. You guarantee that all the information you provide in the course of the registration procedure is true and correct, and you undertake to inform Winch Gate of any change in this information by using the update facility provided as part of your account.\n
	\n
	4. PERSONAL NATURE OF THE ACCOUNT. Use of the account is strictly personal. The account must not, even temporarily, be shared with or otherwise extended to another person (whether free of charge or not), nor may it be used in any way (whether free of charge or not) that is extraneous to the proper normal use of the Game. The User is fully responsible for the use of his/her access account, and for the use made of his/her account by his/her underage child or by any other person who has access to it.\n
	\n
	5. LOGIN AND PASSWORD. To get an account, you must choose a login to connect, and a password; these will enable you to access the account. This login and password are strictly personal and may not be used by anyone else; nor may you use the login and password of any other player. You are fully responsible for your choice of your login and password, for keeping them confidential, and for any use made of them by another person. Winch Gate declines all responsibility for any harm caused to your account by the unauthorized use of your login or password.\n
	\n
	6. SUBSCRIPTION AND BILLING. The current subscription fees are displayed on the website at http://ryzom.com/?page=page_why_pay and again during the registration procedure. These fees may be changed by Winch Gate at any time, provided it notifies the User beforehand, either on the page http://ryzom.com/?page=page_why_pay or when the User logs on to his/her account, or by means of an email message to the User's address. Changes in the applicable fee will only come into effect from the next renewal of the subscription. The subscription fees are expressed in Euros in the Euro zone countries, in Pounds Sterling in the United Kingdom and in US dollars for the United States. The fee is for an exact subscription period (1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year). Subscriptions are, depending on the payment used, either automatically renewed for the same period unless the User gives Winch Gate notice as described in Article 18 below or have to be renewed manually by the User. If the payment has to be renewed manually by the User, the User is responsible for renewing his/her subscription period before it expires, otherwise Winch Gate reserves all rights to immediately close the User's account. Payment of the subscription fee enables the User to access Ryzom without limit during the subscription period and any continuation by renewal. This payment does not cover the costs associated with the Internet connection needed to take out the subscription and to play Ryzom. The subscription fee and any renewals are paid in advance and are not refundable. The subscription can be paid by credit card or debit card or by any other means accepted by Winch Gate, according to the procedures displayed on the Winch Gate website. The subscription fee will be taken from your credit card or debit card automatically at the time of the initial subscription and on the date of each renewal. Winch Gate reserves the right to immediately close a User's account if it proves impossible to secure funds from his/her credit or debit card or other agreed means of payment on any renewal date.\n
	\n
	7. SECURITY OF PAYMENTS. Secure payment by credit card or debit card is ensured by the use of different outsourced payment system companies such as WorldPay ( www.worldpay.com ) and PayPal ( www.paypal.com ), both specialist providers of secure on-line payment transactions, as well as through the Steam portal payment system ( http://store.steampowered.com/ ). Your credit or debit card details (name, type of card, card number and expiry date) are sent encrypted using the SSL protocol directly by the different payment system servers. The banking details provided by the subscriber will be used only for processing and invoicing your payment through.\n
	\n
	8. PRIVACY AND DATA PROTECTION. With accepting this contract, you confirm that you have read and understood Winch Gates' Privacy Policy (http://ryzom.com/?page=privacy_policy). With using Winch Gate's products ("Ryzom“ and "www.ryzom.com“), you are accepting its Privacy Policy. Winch Gate respects the privacy of its online visitors and recognize the importance of providing a secure environment for the information it collects. Winch Gate  may collect data about your ingame behaviour, such as your played time, for statistical analysis. Those statistics will be completely anonymous and will not contain any personal data. However, if Winch Gate collects  personal data for statistics, Winch Gate will inform the user appropriately and will request consent.\n
	\n
	9. LICENSE TO USE RYZOM. This Contract gives you, the User, a limited, non-exclusive and revocable right of access, via a valid account, to the Game server, to use the Game as designed and in accordance with the terms of this Contract, to the exclusion of any other entitlement. This Contract authorizes you to install and use a free copy of the Software. Subject to the restrictions agreed in this Contract, Winch Gate gives you, the User, a non-exclusive and revocable license to use the Game for the sole purpose of playing Ryzom and/or using Ryzom Arkitect tools under legitimate conditions via an authorized, free or fully-paid account. All other uses of  the account or of the Game are forbidden. In particular, you may under no circumstances reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the software program(s) of which the Game consists. You may not transfer all or part of the Game to another person. You may not hire out, lend or sell the Game or any elements, object, design or any content created using the Ryzom Arkitect tools or any other tools. All rights not expressly granted to the User by this Contract are reserved to Winch Gate.\n
	\n
	10. GNU AGPL LICENSE. The source code of the Ryzom client software (part of the software on the User's computer) has been published by Winch Gate under a specific "GNU Affero General Public License", the text of which is accessible at the following URL: https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html. Its use is subject to the terms of that license. It can be downloaded at https://bitbucket.org/ryzom/ryzomcore/.\n
	\n
	11. LATER VERSIONS' IMPROVEMENTS. Neither this Contract nor your account entitles you to any later version or extension of Ryzom and/or Ryzom Arkitect tools. Winch Gate may update or improve the Game, but is under no obligation to provide you with this update or improvement. Provision by Winch Gate of an update or improvement free of charge gives you no entitlement to later updates or improvements.\n
	\n
	12. OWNERSHIP OF THE GAME AND ITS ELEMENTS. Winch Gate is the sole owner of Ryzom and Ryzom Arkitect tools, of all the proprietary elements designed to make it work, and of all the intellectual property rights concerning these elements. You acknowledge that Ryzom and its contents are protected by copyright and by other intellectual property rights held by Winch Gate or its suppliers, and that you have no entitlement beyond the limited license rights expressly granted to you under the terms of Article 7 of this Contract. Winch Gate is also the sole owner of the User's account and of any elements, object, design or content created or used by the User through that account, including but not limited to the characters, their appearance, characteristics, stories, created or manufactured objects, guilds, groups and titles, and of any element, object, design or any content created using the Ryzom Arkitect tools. The User also grants Winch Gate the full property right to use the information sent to the server via the account and of any elements, object, design or any content created using the Ryzom Arkitect tools (with the exception of the personal data and messages addressed to other Users) as it thinks fit, including commercial exploitation.\n
	\n
	13. INFORMATION AND DATA SENT BY THE USER. The information and data communicated or sent by the User in the course of his/her use of Ryzom must not (a) infringe the rights of any other party, including their intellectual property rights, their rights to their image and their right to privacy; (b) breach any law or regulation whatsoever; (c) contain any statement which is defamatory, indecent, obscene or otherwise harmful to minors; or (d) contain any virus, trojan, malicious code, worm, logic bomb, or other computer instruction, program or subprogram which is intended to damage or does damage data or make unauthorized changes to the Ryzom software or the Ryzom servers or the Ryzom Arkitect tools. We reserve the right to take any emergency measures on your account (including suspension or cancellation) which we think fit, if we believe that your use is contravening the above prohibitions.\n
	\n
	14. RULES OF BEHAVIOR. You acknowledge that the proper functioning and success of an On-line Role-playing Game such as Ryzom and/or Ryzom Arkitect depends on a delicate balance which Winch Gate has to maintain. The User is therefore strictly forbidden: (a) to use any program or method to change the content or functionalities of the Game; (b) to cause the server to be overloaded; (c) to use any procedure to make it easier to obtain any instruction faster than through the ordinary course of play; (d) to modify the user interface or any other component in order to obtain objects, experience points, currency, characters' attributes, ranks, etc., other than as the result of proper normal use of the Game; (e) to buy, sell or transfer Game characters or their attributes or any elements, object, design or any content created using the Ryzom Arkitect tools. Furthermore, the User must at all times observe the Code of Conduct, the Courtesy Policies and the Ryzom Naming Charter displayed on the Game's forum page http://app.ryzom.com/app_forum/index.php?page=topic/view/21885/, whose contents are hereby declared an integral part of this Contract. We reserve the right to take any emergency measures on your account (including suspension or cancellation) which we think fit, if we believe that your use is contravening the above prohibitions.\n
	\n
	15. PERSONAL/ USER INFORMATION. Winch Gate' undertakings concerning personal data are contained in the Personal Data Protection Policy displayed on the Ryzom website at www.ryzom.com, which is hereby declared an integral part of this Contract. Winch Gate is not capable of ensuring that personal information communicated by the User to another User in the course of play will not be revealed to another person. In order to enable updates / patches for the Game, you authorize Winch Gate (a) to extract details of your personal profile from your computer equipment; (b) to extract information from your computer about the location of the Game within your file system, and your access rights; and (c) to download Game components, and components required for its installation, to your computer using your account.\n
	\n
	16. GUARANTEE / LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. The Game and the associated services are supplied by Winch Gate "as is", with no other guarantee than the legally-required minimum public order guarantees applicable to this Contract. Any other guarantee, legal or contractual, is expressly excluded. Winch Gate will do its best to make the User's account constantly accessible, but reserves the right to interrupt service due to technical and maintenance activities. Winch Gate can in no way guarantee constant and error-free functioning, however, either of its services or of the Game, nor Users' uninterrupted access to their accounts. In no circumstances shall Winch Gate be held liable in the event of damage to the User's hardware or software when using the Game. Users are reminded in this connection of the need to maintain a proper hardware configuration which meets Winch Gate's recommendations, to update their software regularly and to save their important files on a regular basis. Winch Gate cannot be held liable either for the content of exchanges between players or for players' behavior. Should Winch Gate be held liable for damages on any grounds whatsoever, such liability shall not be greater than the total amount of subscription fees paid by the User.\n
	\n
	17. CESSATION OF OPERATION OF THE GAME BY WINCH GATE. Winch Gate gives no guarantee to the User concerning the duration of its running of the Game. Winch Gate reserves the right to stop providing the Game or maintaining its services, at its sole discretion, if the number of Users becomes or remains too low or in any other circumstances, but shall give the User notice of this by means of a message displayed on accessing the Game, on its website at www.ryzom.com or by email. User accounts will in that case be definitively closed.\n
	\n
	18. CANCELLATION BY WINCH GATE. Winch Gate may cancel this Contract and close the User's account without notice, instantly and without warning or advance notice, if the User breaches any one of his/her obligations under this Contract or any of the conditions imposed by any of the documents that have been declared part of this Contract. If Winch Gate closes the User's account due to a breech of the contract, Winch Gate reserves the right to ban the User's computer, credit card and/or to disable the software from future access to the game. If the computer is banned or the software disabled any other player using the same computer and/or software will be unable to connect. If the credit card on the account is banned, all other accounts that have been opened using the same credit card may also be banned. In that situation no refund shall be due to the User for the portion of the subscription fee corresponding to the days remaining until the normal expiry of the current subscription period.\n
	\n
	19. CANCELLATION BY THE USER. The User can end this Contract and close his/her account at any time by giving Winch Gate notice by email at support@ryzom.com or by other means offered on access to the account. Cancellation shall take effect from the expiry of the current subscription period. Money paid for current subscription fees shall not be refunded, even if the User makes no use of his/her account until the cancellation date.\n
	\n
	20. AMENDMENTS TO THE LICENCE. Winch Gate reserves the right to amend the terms of this Contract at any time. The User will be informed of any amendments to the Contract on the first occasion of accessing his/her account after the change. Accessing the Game will then imply acceptance of the amended terms of the Contract, which will apply immediately.\n
	\n
	21. PRECAUTIONS TO BE TAKEN / EPILEPSY. Winch Gate reminds you that you should not play if you are tired or lacking sleep. Make sure you play in a well-lit room and do not have your screen too bright. When using a video game that can be connected to a screen, play at a reasonable distance from the TV screen, as far as the connection cable allows. Take breaks of ten to fifteen minutes in every hour's play. We also draw your attention to the fact that some people are liable to epileptic attacks which may involve loss of visual awareness, and which may be triggered by certain types of powerful light stimulus: a rapid succession of images or the repetition of simple geometric patterns, or simulation of lightning or explosions. These people expose themselves to the risk of such attacks when they play certain video games containing such stimuli, even where they have no previous medical history or have never been subject to epileptic attacks before. If you yourself or any member of your family has already had any symptoms related to epilepsy (fits or loss of consciousness) in the presence of light stimuli, you should consult your doctor before playing at all. Parents should also pay particular attention to their children when the children are playing video games. If you yourself or your child has any of the following symptoms: vertigo, impaired vision, eye or muscle contractions, impaired sense of direction, involuntary movements or convulsions, or momentary loss of consciousness, you must immediately stop playing and consult a doctor.\n
	\n
	22. APPLICABLE LAW / OTHER PROVISIONS. This Contract is governed by Cyprus law. The United Nations Convention on international contracts for the sale of goods is hereby declared not to apply. Any dispute concerning this Contract shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Cyprus court. If any clause of this Contract should be found null or ineffective with regard to the User, such nullity or lack of effect shall not affect the validity or effectiveness of the Contract's other clauses. This Contract may not be assigned or transferred by the User.]

uiTryton1	[For many centuries I have voyaged through the quiescent corridors of Ryzom. I bore witness to the Green Rising of Atys, and the birth of hominkind. I witnessed their striving for survival in a merciless world of killing plants and swarming beasts. Worse, entrenched in their brutish ignorance they gave themselves to bloodshed in their vying for power with their own kin. Thus weakened by interracial warfare and bound to their territories in their self-imposed segregation, they fell victim to a terrible swarming of kitins.]

uiTryton2	[Even the great Atysian forces of the Kami and the Karavan put together were powerless against the kitin onslaughts in that calamitous year. Entire populations perished. When the dreadful news came to my ears, I did not delay in giving all the assistance I could to save the last survivors, many of whom had dispersed and fled into the wilderness.]

uiTryton3	[Three generations have since passed for healing wounds, rebuilding lives, for introspection and rekindling the spirit of hominkind. The time has now come for the wise and the brave to take up the reins of ambition, to blaze the trail to a new order, to span the rifts between continents and forge the destinies of their civilizations.]

uiTryton4	[This is my one hope, for in unity will we best be armed to repel the tide of advancing evil. Certainly, I already hear the ominous rumblings of the Mega Corp that, alas, shall one day rock the very bowels of the green planet.\n
	But I have faith yet in this, the New Beginning of Mankind\n
